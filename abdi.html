      This is a university common course and all students<br> pursuing certificate, diploma and undergraduate studies are expected to take it. The course will be<br>  offered on an E-learning platform where the learners are expected to interact with <br> <br> the facilitator through on line chats and on line module. The online<br>  module has ELEVEN chapters covering the entire material for the course. The <br> facilitator will grade and comment on your assignments, monitor the learner’s<br>   progress and online presence and also provide answers to the learner’s <br> questions<br>  during chats, therefore assignments must done and  submitted in real time for marking.<br> 
 Students are free to consult the facilitator when the need arises for a face to face<br>  interaction. Especially when:<br>  
A learner does not understand any part of the study units<br> 
A learner has difficulties in understanding on line exercises or tutor-marked assignment<br> 
A learner has problems with the facilitator’s comments on their assignments or their<br>  grading. In order for a learner to gain maximally from facilitator’s interactions, the <br> <br> learner ought to prepare list of questions before the face to face meeting <br> them<br>  <br> and must endeavor to participate, actively, in discussions during chats<br> .
Of importance to note is that communication as the name of the unit clearly spells out is <br> a skill and therefore can only be perfected through practice as practice makes perfect. In line with this understanding learners are expected to practice on their own what is documented in this module for example the learner has to apply the writing skills,<br>  listening skills among other skills in their everyday interactions with their lecturers and other students in the university. Note also in addition to pursuing communication skills for academic purposes it is a life skill so work on perfecting it.
This module is by no means exhaustive and as such learners are expected to interact with various other sources of communication knowledge as in from books, internet to beef up what the module may not have included. This is especially so because we are in communication/ information age when communication dynamisms are changing daily so treat this module as just a guide.
